Using the included dataset, we undertook a modeling exercise following the CRISP-DM framework to determine the most descriptive features determining a used car's value. Our dataset contained 400k used car sales from dealers throughout the country and many related car features.

After applying several modeling steps, we determined the top 5 features for a used car price:
1. model
2. year (higher is better)
3. odometer (lower is better)
4. transmission (other, automatic, manual)
5. fuel type (diesel, other, electric, gas, hybrid)

Additional analysis is located in the Jupyter notebook which is part of this repo.
